# BookedUp

BookedUp is a learning project. It aims to be similar when it comes to its functionalities to goodreads.com.

I'm building Bookedup in order to explore more of **React**'s functionalities.

It uses
**React**,
**Express** and
**MongoDB**.


I'm roughly following a design I made in AdobeXD, that you can find [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/861f949a-111a-421e-5419-7956844ba082-f02e/).

## Installation

Start the server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start
```
Start the frontend application:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```
